## Project Summary

RouteMind is an AI-powered route optimization system that calculates the best path between two points using A* pathfinding and fuzzy logic. Unlike traditional navigation algorithms, RouteMind considers real-world conditions such as traffic, weather, road surface, time of day, and road type to generate dynamic route costs and smarter navigation suggestions.

## Setup & Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyeshaahKhalid/RouteMind_RouteFinder.git
